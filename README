INTRODUCTION

This file documents the "Thumb" interactive Earth demo.  Please note that this is research code. It is not a complete end-user application.  As such, the user interface is very raw, and configuration requires the modification of XML files.

To run the demo, simply double-click thumb.exe.  It will automatically load the Earth model with the following data sets:

    world.200408         Blue Marble Next Generation (August)
                         86400x43200 RGB 24-bit color map
                         Full-earth coverage

    srtm_ramp2           Shuttle Radar Topography Mission /
                         Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project Version 2
                         86400x43200 16-bit height map
                         Full-earth coverage

    srtm_ramp2_normal    Normal map (per-pixel illumination map)
                         86400x43200 24-bit vector map
                         Full-earth coverage

    NED                  National Elevation Dataset
                         30-meter resolution 16-bit height map
                         US Territory

    NED_norm             Normal map (per-pixel illumination map)
                         30-meter resolution 16-bit height map
                         US Territory



CONFIGURATION


The file data/conf.xml defines several variables that configure the interaction and the rendering quality.  In general they need not be changed unless there is a serious problem.

The following files contain the paths of the 5 data sets listed above.  These *MUST* be modified in order for the application to find the data.

    data/world.200408.xml
    data/srtm_ramp2.xml
    data/srtm_ramp2_normal.xml
    data/NED.xml
    data/NED_normal.xml



USAGE

The default interaction mode uses the keyboard and mouse, as follows:

            Left-button drag      Pitch and Yaw the viewpoint
    Shift + Left-button drag      Roll the viewpoint

            Mouse wheel           Rotate the Earth about its axis
    Shift + Mouse wheel           Alter the axial tilt of the Earth

            W                     Move forward
            S                     Move backward
            A                     Move left
            D                     Move right

            Home                  Reset the viewpoint
            Escape                Exit

    Shift + F3                    Toggle monochrome relief-shading
    Shift + F4                    Toggle wireframe geometry
    Shift + F5                    Toggle color/normal cache display
    Shift + F6                    Toggle height cache display
    Shift + F7/F8/F9              Toggle GPGPU buffer display

    Shift + Spacebar              Enter auto-demo mode
    Shift + Page Up               Advance to next demo checkpoint
    Shift + Page Down             Advance to previous checkpoint
