prepobj.c preprocesses an OBJ/MTL file pair for use with Thumb.  It
eliminates identical vertices in the OBJ in order to optimize
rendering performance and ensure that Thumb can produce correct
tangent vectors at load time.  It also performs a basic triangle
reordering in order to improve the object's average cache miss ratio,
further improving run-time performance.

prepobj.c also reads and translates the MTL file, giving a series of
Thumb material specification XML files.  Each resulting XML file is
named after the diffuse texture given in the map_Kd element of the
input material. If multiple materials use the same diffuse texture,
then they will be collapsed into a single material.  The usemtl
references in the OBJ file are rewritten to use the new material
names.

Usage:

    prepobj <obj> [dir]

        obj ... The OBJ file to be processed
        dir ... An optional subdirectory name to be prepended to all
                material file and texture names.
