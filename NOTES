Replace widget show() with a parent->poke?
    This would remove the need to pass the root of the control to all create buttons
    group nodes would poke all OTHER children plus parent
Assymmetry with hide() ... only ever called to apply parameters?

The lang dependance could be moved from gui to control.

C++ notes
    Virtual base classes shouldn't have data members?

I often delete members in dtors.  Should these use auto_ptrs?  const ones?
    Don't use auto_ptrs in assumed-assignable objects
        Such as objects you'd flatly add to containers.

Is mutable appropriate anywhere?  (say in glob)  Where const implies policy rather than mechanism?

Bald pointer members (and auto_ptr members) may need copy constructors and copy assignment operators.

Encapsulate GL objects in trivial Gen/Delete wrappers?

Consider using deque vector caches in the OBJ loader.  Profile.

Octree notes

        Needs
                Frustum culling for rendering to camera and lightsource views
                Rubber band selection
                Picking (optionally)
                Front-back sorting
                Invariant preservation is the tough issue
                "All" arbitrary iteration

        ODE planes could do rubber band selection, but probably are not
        appropriate for render culling.

        A log(n) implementation MAY not be a performance improvement
                The tipping point is probably around 1000 objects


        Implementation
                Explicit point representation (PR)
                Recursive AABB subdivision (MX)
                        Doesn't grow as nicely as PR
                Plane straddling could be tough


        Static grid octree or quadtree

                Invariants
                        Each entity is in exactly ONE cell
                        This cell is the smallest that contains the entity

                For each moving entity
                        While the entity is NOT within its current cell
                                Move it up (necessary)

                        If the entity fits within a subcell of the current cell
                                Move it down (optimization)

                Entities outside the static index
                        Sit at the root
                                Root is infinitely large
                or
                        Can't happen
                                ODE planes bound the space
                                This would also allow quadtree space to work



scene
        for each emit
                draw the objects the emit can see to depth

                for each recv
                        for each pass
                                draw the objects the recv can see to color


(water is both a recv (with lower prio than camera) and a draw)

Global view object
        push/pop
        camera entities are allowed to modify it
        light sources can use it for CSM
        entities can check culling against it
        octree can refuse to insert as cull and insert visible in order
