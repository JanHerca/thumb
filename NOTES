Octree notes

        Needs
                Frustum culling for rendering to camera and lightsource views
                Rubber band selection
                Picking (optionally)
                Front-back sorting
                Invariant preservation is the tough issue
                "All" arbitrary iteration

        ODE planes could do rubber band selection, but probably are not
        appropriate for render culling.

        A log(n) implementation MAY not be a performance improvement
                The tipping point is probably around 1000 objects


        Implementation
                Explicit point representation (PR)
                Recursive AABB subdivision (MX)
                        Doesn't grow as nicely as PR
                Plane straddling could be tough


        Static grid octree

                Invariants
                        Each entity is in exactly ONE cell
                        This cell is the smallest that contains the entity

                For each moving entity
                        While the entity is NOT within its current cell
                                Move it up (necessary)

                        If the entity fits within a subcess of the current cell
                                Move it down (optimization)

                Entities outside the static index
                        Sit at the root
                                Root is infinitely large
                or
                        Can't happen
                                ODE planes bound the space
                                This would also allow quadtree space to work
