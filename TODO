Figure out why shadows (with terrain loaded) don't work when looking into the sun.
Test the new kizhi models. with normal maps.
Shift-F3 to go into movie mode?
   document movie making
Render sky on far clipping plane
Wireframe mode

OBJ island
document conf settings
test GL fallbacks
shadow options (map count, pcf)

grep '.hpp' *.hpp 

Check all Kizhi textures to ensure that opaque are RGB and masked are RGBA.
pngcrush them

When seeking the near plane it, distance's important to consider only objects which are in view.  It's not only a question of "how far in front of this plane is this box" but "how far in front of this plane is the portion of the box in front of all these other planes too?" This is a very challenging problem.

Make F10 reload work again.  Check for leaks.  Ensure all GL state is reloadable without disturbing application state.  Use this to find a way to switch displays on the fly.
   Hard vs Sorf
       Hard is a close/start
       Soft is a glob::fini/init

Backface culling should be a material (binding) option

move rect into gui?

Get rid of main.hpp entirely
    encapsulate that state

do the TODOs and the HACKs

Refactor app::prog->next()/prev()
    move all attr_* to app::user?

Modernize the GL
    Eliminate immedate mode stuff
        most everything can be moved into the pool handler
    Eliminate fixed function stuff
    Eliminate the attribute stack usage
    Is glUniform slow?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

convert geomip upload to PBO

Consider rechecking the tracker after the draw but before the combine.
    Perhaps do the combine in response to the flip message.
    And include a sensor update there.

is the primary depth buffer necessary?

Fix cracking between cached pages.
Fix cracking between spatches.

If the range extrema of each heightmap is stored as metadata then an extremely tight tile visibility becomes possible.  Patch visibility with no round trip may follow from this.

There's no need to respect the jiffy in edit mode.
    To ignore it would improve performance on huge scenes nicely.
Don't free-run in edit mode.

Clone light should clone the shadow and lightmap references.
Convert light and camera entity draw to use OBJ
Reduce the number of string passes by value in the gui module.

Control panes on function keys?
    F5 info about
    F6 info world
    F7 info solid
    F8 info joint

Add entity scaling.
    Uniform only?
        + would preserve sphereness of spheres
        + would ensure texture uniformity
        - would force a variety of sized OBJs
Add new ODE geoms.
    Cylinder
    Capsule
    Heightfield
    Plane
    Convex?
    Ray?
Add DDS support
    Cube map load
    DXT load
    Mipmap load

Water.
    Bouyancy force.
    Optional GPU ripple integrator.
    Changable water depth?
Skeletal animation.
Documentation.
Rubber-band select.
Object-inside-object select?
Intro text / flowing widget.
World parameters
Selection registers.
Center contraint on a group.
Partial run.
Refresh button on finder.
    Make Up button nicer.
    Icon view.
Conveyer solid property.
Static / package data archives with Z compression.
Figure out why repeated runs differ.
    Body order?
