There's still a bug in geomap when teleporting

tellurion

    next
        geomap resolution select

    For the demo
-       cluster sync
-       stereo
-       tracking / interaction
        destination select
        specular map
        cloud map
-       geomap
        patch crack
-       atmosphere
        stars
        sun
        mars
        moon
        hilo normal map?
        dxt color map?
-       normal mapping




There's no need to respect the jiffy in edit mode.
    To ignore it would improve performance on huge scenes nicely.
Don't free-run in edit mode.
Create a staging area for vert_cache.
Generalize binding further:
    zbuffer
    diffuse
    ambient
binding comparison modes: color, depth
Add AABB and bound sphere caching to mesh
Add AABB and bound sphere update to segment/element
tune near and far using bound
implement visibility checking in batcher
implement SSM
implement PSSM
sort meshes
sort bindings
mutable bindings to reduce state change
use non-interleaved VBOs and bind only the necessary attributes

Apparently geoms in different spaces collide even when their collision bits indicate they should not.  This is a problem because dynamic objects always collide with static.
Clone light should clone the shadow and lightmap references.
Convert light and camera entity draw to use OBJ
Reduce the number of string passes by value in the gui module.


General
    read gotw.ca/gotw
        #54 shrinking vectors

Control panes on function keys?
    F5 info about
    F6 info world
    F7 info solid
    F8 info joint

Add entity scaling.
    Uniform only?
        + would preserve sphereness of spheres
        + would ensure texture uniformity
        - would force a variety of sized OBJs
Add new ODE geoms.
    Cylinder
    Capsule
    Heightfield
    Plane
    Convex?
    Ray?
Add DDS support
    Cube map load
    DXT load
    Mipmap load
Incorporate some of the shading/buffer/image/state lessons learned from atmo.
Incorporate perf module from atmo.  Stats in GUI?
Generalize the "follow" mechanism to "enable".
Move sky/earth/sun ownership to scene.

Water.
    Bouyancy force.
    Optional GPU ripple integrator.
    Changable water depth?
Skeletal animation.
Documentation.
Rubber-band select.
Object-inside-object select?
Intro text / flowing widget.
World parameters
Selection registers.
Center contraint on a group.
Partial run.
Refresh button on finder.
    Make Up button nicer.
    Icon view.
Optimize constraint drawing -- integrate display lists with glob?  Use OBJ?
Optimize wire drawing.
Conveyer solid property.
Static / package data archives with Z compression.
Figure out why repeated runs differ.
    Body order?

OBJ support:
    map wrapping
    map scale and translate

Data archives

    a common path naming scheme that transparently accesses all archives
    in prioritized order

    priority
        cwd    rw
        home   rw
        pak2   r
        pak1   r
        pak0   r
        static r

    load searches r archives in order
    save searches w archives in order
