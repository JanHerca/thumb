generalize tile specification to allow
    specification using
        corner or
        fov plus transform
generalize frustum handling to allow
    unions of frusta for stereo
generalize screen-filling rectangle to allow
    arbitrary edge-blended polygon


The 7900 bug may involve the quantity of geometry / utilization of the geometry cache.  A workaround may involve doing a full-cache PBO-to-VBO copy regardless of the cache state.

short term:
    fix lightsource position
    can the initial connect socket be closed early?

map atlas
patch cracking
more data
consider forward rendering

The 3 phases of sphere generation can be pipelined.  The only requirement is in being able to predict the view frustum 2 frames in advance.  To do this, simply consider the difference from the last frame and extrapolate.  This will be correct for constant velocity, which will cover 90% of circumstances.

If the range extrema of each heightmap is stored as metadata then an extremely tight tile visibility becomes possible.  Patch visibility with no round trip may follow from this.

        specular map NOT part of normal map (res will differ)
        cloud map NOT part of color map (must animate)

There's no need to respect the jiffy in edit mode.
    To ignore it would improve performance on huge scenes nicely.
Don't free-run in edit mode.
Create a staging area for vert_cache.
Generalize binding further:
    zbuffer
    diffuse
    ambient
binding comparison modes: color, depth
Add AABB and bound sphere caching to mesh
Add AABB and bound sphere update to segment/element
tune near and far using bound
implement visibility checking in batcher
implement SSM
implement PSSM
sort meshes
sort bindings
mutable bindings to reduce state change
use non-interleaved VBOs and bind only the necessary attributes

Apparently geoms in different spaces collide even when their collision bits indicate they should not.  This is a problem because dynamic objects always collide with static.
Clone light should clone the shadow and lightmap references.
Convert light and camera entity draw to use OBJ
Reduce the number of string passes by value in the gui module.
