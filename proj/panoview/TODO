Todo:

	Pages fade in, but do they pop away?

	Should model::tick call cache::update?

	NAC overlay

	WAC GLOBAL starts to look a little low res
		Cubic interpolation?
			Store derivatives or other higher-order data along side grayscale?
		Have a detail texture fade in

	The GLD seam at +/- 60 is still subtly visible. Mix in some LDEM.

	Add the overlay XML to the pan definition.

	Adaptive map scale
