Todo:

	NAC overlay

	WAC GLOBAL starts to look a little low res
		Cubic interpolation?
		Have a detail texture fade in

	Normalized height values need an unsigned override option.

	The GLD seam at +/- 60 is still subtly visible. Mix in some LDEM.

	Add the overlay XML to the pan definition.

	Adaptive map scale
