Todo:

	Below the ground not black

-	Configurable joystic dead zone
	option
		Trip time depends upon distance
		OR
-		Move really high during the rip
-			Configurable?
-	Multi-image frame selection in goto
	Other data
		http://lro.gsfc.nasa.gov/mini-rf.html

-	Prepare scmtiff and query for Adler

	Fix panoview zoom.

	There are MANY passes over most Apollo sites
		Convert them all and make animations
		http://apollo.mem-tek.com/LRO_NAC_Apollo_Images.html
-	Complex interpolated camera motion
-		Implemented in view-app
-			so both panorama and orbiter benefit
-		Orbiter path planning
-			high quality render-out
		Dynamic zoomy presentation mode
			this will require path integration with scmtiff

	Make some movies of Apollo sites with horizon pans.

	Unified dataset
		Use the channels of the image
			Height
				LO-HI might be good, but precludes filtering
			Color
			Normal X-Y
		Gets us in under 16 TIUs
		Laplace pyramid
			Eases multichannel
				allows low res data to be zeroed in high res pages
			scmtiff
				scmtiff -p mipmap
				scmtiff -p laplace
				scmtiff -p channel

	Pages fade in, but do they pop away?

	Modify page priority to account for "image center".

	WAC GLOBAL starts to look a little low res
		Cubic interpolation?
			Store derivatives or other higher-order data along side grayscale?
		Have a detail texture fade in

-	Add the overlay XML to the pan definition.

	Adaptive map scale
