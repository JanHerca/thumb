	There are MANY passes over most Apollo sites
		Convert them all and make animations
		http://apollo.mem-tek.com/LRO_NAC_Apollo_Images.html
	Complex interpolated camera motion
		Implemented in scm-viewer
			so both panorama and orbiter benefit
		Orbiter path planning
			high quality render-out
		Dynamic zoomy presentation mode
			this will require path integration with scmtiff

	Make some movies of Apollo sites with horizon pans.

	Unified dataset
		Use the channels of the image
			Height
				LO-HI might be good, but precludes filtering
			Color
			Normal X-Y
		Gets us in under 16 TIUs
		Laplace pyramid
			Eases multichannel
				allows low res data to be zeroed in high res pages
			scmtiff
				scmtiff -p mipmap
				scmtiff -p laplace
				scmtiff -p channel

	Pages fade in, but do they pop away?

	WAC GLOBAL starts to look a little low res
		Cubic interpolation?
			Store derivatives or other higher-order data along side grayscale?
		Have a detail texture fade in

	Add the overlay XML to the pan definition.

	Adaptive map scale


Moon Script

	Begin with LOLA + WAC + NAC Apollo 16 + NAC Tycho full moon
	Introduce WAC
	Zoom in to show the 3D terrain
	Introduce LOLA
	Note the size of a NAC strip
	Zoom in to show Apollo 16
	Landing site, Tracks West, House Rock
	Move to Tycho
	Circle the mountain
	Zoom in on the boulder
	Switch to real-time lighting
	Describe the data layering
	Show the south pole
	Switch to false-color height
	Show the highest point
	Switch to side-by-side configuration
	Show LOLA and GLD false color
	Show LOLA and GLD normal
