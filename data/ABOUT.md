Thumb is my personal real-time 3D graphics research codebase, presented in the
form of a library. It provides a rendering engine with a highly-configurable
shading system wrapping an ODE physical simulation with an in-engine world
editor. A wide array of stereoscopic displays and virtual reality devices are
supported, and a distributed synchronization mechanism enables cluster-parallel
rendering.
