Cracking may be occuring because one interpolant is k while the other is k-1


Bouncing between eyes and tiles screws with patch hierarchy coherence
    nearly all leaves are invalidated when the tile changes

define a plural frame buffer?
    give an array of
        view frustum planes
        view point
        frame area
    frustum union planes

for each patch
    given the sphere area (normal and radius)
    determine the eye area (x0 y0 x1 y1)
    determine the frame area (x0 y0 x1 y1)
    determine the pixel density (sphere area / frame area)

    for each geomap
        for each tile touching the sphere area
            with at least the maximum pixel density
            enqueue texture object and frame area

    for each queued texture object
        render all frame areas (or just the union of all frame areas?)


send [sphere area, frame rect] pairs to the root of the geomap
    let tiles accumulate rects
draw the geomap

(this could enable smart LOD blending)
